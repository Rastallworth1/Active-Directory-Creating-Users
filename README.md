For this home lab, we want to create a new user called Reggie. First, click on the example (local) entry. This is the entry for the domain that your account can manage. Next, scroll down and double click on the Users entry to see the list of users and groups that currently exist.<br/>

<br />


<br />
Now, lets create a new user. First, take a look at the tasks list on the right. Under the Users section, there's a New menu entry, which opens a submenu to select what's the type of entity that you want to create. In this case, we want to create a new user, so click User. <br/>

<br />
Go to your System Restore Point. ** DO NOT restore your device ** Malware creators are aware of restore points and can create Malware to affect System Restore Points. It is better to remove System Restore Points. Type "create a restore point" in the system menu and open it. Click on configure, disable system protection, and delete the restore point. Once the issue is resolved, create a new restore point.  <br/>

<br />
Reset your browser setting. In some cases, Malware could infect your browser setting and redirect you to a malicious site that could re-infect your system. In Google Crome, click on the menu button, then settings. On the left side, select the reset and cleanup option and pick restore setting to their orginal defaults.  <br/>

<br />


<br />
In this scenario, resetting the browser setting resolved the issue. Remember to always ask questions to get a good understanding of when the issue started, what has changed, and a get a very good description of the issue!  <br/>
