The Active Directory Administrative Center is your main page. It allows you to manage your Active Directory installation, by configuring users, groups, computers, and more.<br/>

<br />
For this home lab, we want to create a new user called Reggie. First, click on the example (local) entry. This is the entry for the domain that your account can manage. Next, scroll down and double click on the Users entry to see the list of users and groups that currently exist.<br/>

<br />


<br />
Now, lets create a new user. First, take a look at the tasks list on the right. Under the Users section, there's a New menu entry, which opens a submenu to select what's the type of entity that you want to create. In this case, we want to create a new user, so click User. <br/>

<br />
This will open a new window that lets you fill in a number of fields related to the new user. There are numerous fields available, but only a couple are mandatory, which are marked with a read star. You can leave the rest empty. The user that we are creating is called Reggie, with their username being also Reggie.<br/>

<br />
<br />Once you've entered the necessary information, click the OK button to create the user (Reggie). 
<br/>




<br />
Once you click on the newly created account, you will see that where it displays the name of the user, the system says Reggie (Disabled).  <br/>

In this scenario, resetting the browser setting resolved the issue. Remember to always ask questions to get a good understanding of when the issue started, what has changed, and a get a very good description of the issue!  <br/>
