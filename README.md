Run a Windows Defender Offline Scan in order to scan the system before the Operatining System or any executables start. This will allow your system to find any Malware in your central systems, such as as drivers. (This may take a while)  <br/>

<br />
Go to your System Restore Point. ** DO NOT restore your device ** Malware creators are aware of restore points and can create Malware to affect System Restore Points. It is better to remove System Restore Points. Type "create a restore point" in the system menu and open it. Click on configure, disable system protection, and delete the restore point. Once the issue is resolved, create a new restore point.  <br/>

<br />
Reset your browser setting. In some cases, Malware could infect your browser setting and redirect you to a malicious site that could re-infect your system. In Google Crome, click on the menu button, then settings. On the left side, select the reset and cleanup option and pick restore setting to their orginal defaults.  <br/>

In this scenario, resetting the browser setting resolved the issue. Remember to always ask questions to get a good understanding of when the issue started, what has changed, and a get a very good description of the issue!  <br/>
